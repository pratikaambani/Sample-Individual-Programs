Machine learning is a branch in computer
science that studies the design of algorithms that can learn.
Typical machine learning tasks are conc
ept learning, function learning or “predictive modelin
g”, clustering and finding predictive patterns. These tasks are learned thro
ugh available data that were observed thr
ough experi
ences or instructions, for ex
ample. Machine learning hopes that including the experienc
e into its tasks will eventually improve the learning. The ultimate goal
is to improve the learning in such
a way that it becomes automatic, so that humans like ourselves don’t
 need to interfere any more.
